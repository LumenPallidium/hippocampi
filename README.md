# Hippocampi
WIP

## Introduction

This repository contains implementations of computational models of the hippocampus.

Specifically, it contains an implementation of the paper (High-capacity flexible hippocampal associative and episodic memory enabled by prestructured “spatial” representations)[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.28.568960v1], which itself relies on [continuous attractor networks](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000291) and [Hebbian rules for learning pseudoinverses](https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.3368).
